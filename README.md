### About
__sync-execution__ is a python program that can run an algorithmic language __sync__ (code name).
<br/>
The language itself is a kind of notation that allows you to visualize algorithms and logical schemes.

### Project requirements
Project available for pure __Python 3.8__, but it is possible to run it on older versions.
<br/>
To draw diagrams you can use any diagram editor (based on __jgraph's__ Drawio https://github.com/jgraph/drawio). 

### Ð¡ontent
- __resources__ contains versions of programming language
- __examples__ contains examples of language construction and typical exercises' solution
- __scripts__ contains base of program 

## Personal Node
If you want to create your own node, use scripts in __drawer__. 
But to run them you need to install __svgwrite__. 
```
$ pip install svgwrite
```
After installing run `new_node.py` with changed node specification.
In variable `style` you will get style for Drawio, it add/removes connectors and add some special information.
To add node drag svg-image on Drawio's workspace and append style in this diagram block (select block and press `ctrl-e`).
